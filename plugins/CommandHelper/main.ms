#   Sample Main file. This file is run when the server
#   starts up, or the plugin is reloaded. It can be used
#   as an opportunity to register events or do other things
#   when the server initially starts. Variables defined here
#   will go out of scope, so you can't assign() something and
#   then use it in a command, for instance.
